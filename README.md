#Skip Hulu ads (sort of)

This extensions adds a small input where you can set a timer that sets a countdow to whatever amount of seconds you choose and alerts you when it's finished.

When hulu ads start:

Type in the input box right next to the search box the number of seconds the ads will last.

Optionally mute the volume.

Go do something.

An alert will notify you when the time is up (with three extra seconds to get ready).

Enjoy!

Is this the best option? 

Definitely not but none of the alternatives like adblocks (or even hulu specific extension) seem to work so this is the best I can do that hulu can't interfere with.
